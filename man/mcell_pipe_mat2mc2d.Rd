\title{Linear simple pipeline for turning a matrix to a MC and plotting std figs}
\usage{
mcell_pipe_mat2mc2d(
  mat_id,
  T_vm = 0.2,
  T_tot = 200,
  T_top3 = 3,
  Knn = 120,
  n_resamp = 500,
  T_weight = round(n_resamp * 0.75/8)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat_id}{the id to start from}

\item{T_vm}{threshold on normalized varmin, for selecting markers. Lower this is you don't get enough info from the selected markers. (0.2)}

\item{T_tot}{threshold on minimal total expression for markers (200)}

\item{T_top3}{threshold on minimal number of genes in the top3 expressing cells for markers (3)}

\item{Knn}{the raw Knn parameter used for constructing a balanced Knn graph. This should be set to roughly the size of desired metacells (120)}

\item{n_resamp}{number of bootstraps (500). Decrease to save time.}

\item{T_weight}{number of co-clustering occurences in bootstrap to add an edge in the phase of generating metacells from the bootstrap co-clustering matrix.}
}
\description{
The simplification here is that all objects (mat, gstat, marker gset, cgraph, coclust, mc, mc2d) will have the same ID and will be produced linerly without much questions asked. Also the parameters are simplified for typical use in small datasets.
