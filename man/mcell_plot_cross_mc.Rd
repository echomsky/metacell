\title{Plotting a matrix of co-occurences between two metacell covers of the same dataset}
\usage{
mcell_plot_cross_mc(mc_id1, mc_id2, ord_1 = NULL, ord_2 = NULL, not_log = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{mc_id1}{first mc object to use}

\item{mc_id2}{second mc object to use}

\item{ord_1}{optional ordering of first MC set (default is original order)}

\item{ord_2}{optional ordering of second MC set (Default is based on max intersection with the first set)}

\item{not_log}{use this to avoid using log scale on the colors - making the best match MC more pronanouced}
